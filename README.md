# MICROSHELL
Simple implementation of unix shell, working simillar to bash.
Custom commands list - same functionality as in bash: 
- "pwd"
- "hostname"
- "whoami"
- "exit"
- "help"
- "cd"
- "clear"
- "mv"
- "cp"
- "colors" - change display colors
Every other bash command, that was not implemented should work fine (using fork() + exec*()).
